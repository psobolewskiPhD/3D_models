## UCS 24W Diam15p3mm Depth1mm

This is a 24W variant of the cell seeding device described in:  
https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/299966v2.full  
The model is based on by @preynoldssco:  
https://github.com/preynoldssco/UCS/blob/master/3DPrintedSeeder_OBJET_001.stl  
but I re-made it in order to resize it to 24W plates (VWR brand) that we work with.   
The outer diamter is 15.3 mm to fit the well, the inner diameter is 13.5 mm to accomodate the 13 mm coverslips we use, and the depth of the fluid layer is 1 mm. 
The .step file should be editable in common CAD programs.
